Please check codes in backend folder

Please run reset request in demo folder first.


I show extra sample module to show how module will work and reset database easily.

I also show how to work with complex field type like json,array.

I use eslint to check code quality.

api.yaml if change matchCriteria from in body to in query to match real codes it will show error in http://editor.swagger.io/
This is limited with swagger 2.0 spec editor.
